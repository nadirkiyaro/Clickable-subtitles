# Amharic Clickable Subtitles

This project helps learners study Amharic through **clickable subtitles** synced to a YouTube video.

## 🔧 How It Works:
- Each subtitle line shows:
  - **Amharic script (Fidel)**
  - **Phonetic transcription**
  - **English translation**
- Clicking any subtitle:
  - Displays a popup with all three versions
  - (Note: Video does **not** pause automatically, since it's embedded from YouTube)

## ▶️ How to Use:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Watch the video and click any subtitle line to learn its meaning.

## 📁 Files:
- `index.html` — Embedded YouTube player + interactive subtitles
- `besintu_ep1_subtitles.json` — Subtitle data with Fidel, phonetics, and translations
